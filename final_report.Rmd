# Introduction

\raggedright

This environmental scan is a method for evaluating the quality of care delivered to critically ill children at health facilities. It was developed by the Pediatric Sepsis CoLaboratory and the British Columbia Children’s Hospital’s Centre for International Child Health in partnership with the World Federation of Intensive and Critical Care Societies (WFPICCS), and in close collaboration with partners and child health 
programs in countries.  
This survey combines elements from other surveys and instruments including WHO, SARA, and various publications. The health facility survey has been reviewed by experts caring for critically ill children from around the globe.  
The purpose of this environmental scan is to support health facilities in identifying and assessing quality improvement (QI) priorities and initiatives. QI is a proven, effective way to improve care for patients and to improve practice for health workers. In the healthcare system, there are always opportunities to optimize, streamline, develop and test processes. This tool can be used (1) as a practical method to 
collect baseline facility and health worker performance data, (2) periodically over time to assess the impact of changes made through the QI process, and (3) as a research tool to compare quality of care across a geographical region or set of facilities.  
This survey measures facility resources in a number of areas, for example; infection control, facility infrastructure, and availability of essential medicines. The survey also measures health workers practices in areas such as history taking, physical examinations and treatment practices.

# Modules 

\raggedright

There are 4 modules within the environmental scan. For best results, it is advised to do them in the following order and have all completed. However, only 2 of these modules were complete for this assessment (module 1 and 2). Modules 3 and 4 will be completed at a later date.   

**Module 1: Health Facility Survey of Facility Resources**  
The health facility survey gathers information regarding (1) the availability of resources and services in the health facility and (2) the readiness of the health facility to provide specific services to a defined minimum standard.  

**Module 2: Observational Scan of Health Worker Practices**  
The observational scan assesses the quality and safety of care through observation of a health worker in suspected cases of pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria, in order to assess adherence to standards in the patient care process. The assessor observes a health worker through five patient phases: medical history, physical examination, laboratory investigations, treatment and post-treatment.  

**Module 3: Health Worker Perception Survey**  
The health worker perception survey is a questionnaire for the health worker to assess their views of the quality of care provided at the facility.  

**Module 4: Patient/Caretaker Perception Survey**  
The caretaker perception survey assesses the caretaker’s view of the quality of care they received while at the facility. Through completing all 4 modules, the Scan is able to provide a holistic review of the quality of care provided to patients and areas of which should be prioritized for quality improvement.

**Resource** subcategories examined your institution's test availability, processing equipment, lab equipment, refrigeration, pharmacy/supply room medication stock, imaging capabilities, and availability of blood products.  
**Facility** subcategories examined your institution's hospital transportation equipment, communications infrastructure, utilities availability, presence of job aides, and hygiene standards.    
**Infrastructure** section examines three department areas of your hospital: ER, Pediatric Ward, and the Outpatient Department. Each of these areas are further subdivided into layout, triage protocols, power/utilities, hygiene standards, medication & equipment availability.
